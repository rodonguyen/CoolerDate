    "I applied MERN architecture (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS), designed suitable database schemas, implemented multi-step forms and a multitude of API endpoints, and utilised React Hooks (e.g., useMemo), all of which have broadened my experience in Full-stack development, System Design, and Database Modeling. Furthermore, I fully automated server testing process using Chai framework due to high level of complexity.",
